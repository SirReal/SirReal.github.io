Over the course of the past year or so I have had the pleasure of adopting many of the new tools available to web developers.

This all started thanks to [Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I'd been interested in css preprocessors for a while, and, after diving in thanks to Bootstrap, I started using [Less](http://lesscss.org/) instead of vanilla CSS whenever possible, AKA always. That was great, because Less made my life better in general. Everything was good. I though I was really rocking. I even got really hyped about `make` and Makefiles and all that cool stuff, which I'd never really thought of applying to my workflow.

Then Bootstrap started using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), which was another one of those things I'd been hearing about but hadn't really gotten my feet wet. All of a sudden that pretty ugly, hacky feeling Makefile had turned into some that seemed a lot better. Everything just seemed clearer and like "this was it". It was like make 2.0.

<!-- maybe get into the less/sass/stylus... stuff. How it's all good, bla bla -->

Then all of a sudden twitter seemed to blow up and the dev community collectively decided Grunt was soooo-last-week and Gulp was *IT*. Naturally I wanted to catch this trend on it's upswing and not wait until it was already in Bootstrap, so I started playing with it a bunch, got pretty frustrate along the way, and learned a bunch.

Mark Dahls article was interesting, it's not as mature at Grunt. but it's fun to play with

those other gulp articles were great.

Right now, as I write this article, I've got a solid setup. I plan to make some improvements, there are a few things I know I want to add, but right now I'm pretty darn happy and I'd like to share that with you.
