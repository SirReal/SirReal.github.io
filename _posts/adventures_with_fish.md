Over the past couple of weeks, I've been [fish][fish], the Friendly Interactive SHell, as my primary shell. I spend all of my working day and much of my free time in a terminal. The experience has been largely satisfying, I can't say I've found any _real_ turnoffs at this point,

## TL;DR



1. Is familiar (or close enough to bash that there's no big learning curve).
1. Is fast.
1. Has excellent completion support.
